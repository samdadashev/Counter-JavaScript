# Counter-JavaScript

Its not a lot to talk about , ist a small project that should have a few options :

1. You should have two buttons  one is for adding and the second one is for subtracting .
2. It should not be possible for you to get a negative number as an answer , should have a small window to tell you that its not possible .
3. If the counter shows you the number 0 or less the button of substracting should be disabled and it should be visible .
Those are all points that i needed to focus right now.
